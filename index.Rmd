## Data Wrangling, Exploration, Visualization

### Sarah Zhang (sz6753)

#### Introduction 

The two datasets that I chose are gpa_study_hours and satgpa which I obtained from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html. The gpa_study_hours dataset has 193 rows and 2 variables: gpa and study_hours. The gpa variable represents the grade point average of a college student and the study_hours variable represents the number of hours that student studies per week. The satgpa dataset has 1000 rows and 6 variables: sex, sat_v, sat_m, sat_sum, hs_gpa, and fy_gpa. The sex variable represents the sex of a college student, the sat_v variable represents the verbal SAT percentile of that student, the sat_m variable represents the math SAT percentile of that student, the sat_sum variable represents the total of verbal and math SAT percentiles of that student, the hs_gpa variable represents the high school grade point average of that student, and the fy_gpa variable represents the first year (college) grade point average of that student.

I chose these datasets because I was interested in seeing how the amount study hours a student spends is related to that student's SAT scores. I'm interested in this because I feel that I tend to study a lot and I would like to see if, in general, students who study more tend to have high test scores. Since both datasets have a gpa variable I will be joining them based on the gpa variable from the gpa_study_hours dataset and the fy_gpa variable from the satgpa dataset.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
study_hours <- read_csv('gpa_study_hours.csv')
sat <- read_csv('satgpa.csv')
head(study_hours)
head(sat)
```

#### Tidying: Reshaping

If your datasets are tidy already, demonstrate that you can reshape data with pivot wider/longer here (e.g., untidy and then retidy). Alternatively, it may be easier to wait until the wrangling section so you can reshape your summary statistics. Note here if you are going to do this.

```{R}
study_hours <- study_hours %>% pivot_wider(names_from="gpa",values_from="study_hours")
sat <- sat %>% pivot_wider(names_from="sex",values_from="sat_sum")
head(study_hours)
head(sat)
study_hours <- study_hours %>% pivot_longer(-1, names_to="gpa",values_to="study_hours", values_drop_na=T)
sat <- sat %>% pivot_longer(c("1", "2"), names_to="sex",values_to="sat_sum", values_drop_na=T)
head(study_hours)
head(sat)
```
